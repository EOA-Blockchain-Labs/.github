# What is this org about?

**[Ethereum on ARM](https://github.com/ethereum-on-arm)** builds and maintains Linux images and tools that turn cheap ARM64 boards into full Ethereum nodes and staking boxes with almost no manual setup.

The project focuses on L1 and L2 infrastructure, so you can run execution, consensus, and even **[OP‑Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/)** based networks on a tiny, low‑power machine at home.

## How to get involved

* **Jump into the repo:** Open **[Issues](https://github.com/ethereum-on-arm/ethereum-on-arm/issues)** if you spot bugs, missing boards, or have ideas for new features.
* **Contribute:** Send **[Pull Requests](https://github.com/ethereum-on-arm/ethereum-on-arm/pulls)** for images, scripts, monitoring, and docs – hardware notes and benchmarks are super helpful too.
* **Join the Community:** Hang out in the channels to share setups, ask questions, and help other node runners:
    * [Discord](https://discord.gg/ethereum) (Look for the #arm channel)
    * [Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/ethereumonarm)
    * [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM)

## Good starting points

* **Docs:** The **[Read the Docs site](https://ethereum-on-arm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** has quick start, user guide, and advanced sections if you want to go from *flash* → *synced* in one sitting.
* **Releases:** Grab ready‑to‑use images for supported boards from the **[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ethereum-on-arm/ethereum-on-arm/releases)**.
* **Background reading:** If you are new to nodes, the official **[Ethereum “run a node” guide](https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/)** gives a nice overview of what you are actually running.

## A couple of fun bits
* **Efficiency:** Yes, you can run an archive node plus a validator on a sub‑$200 ARM board sipping around **10 W**, which is pretty wild for a “home lab” box.
* **Longevity:** Some early users started with Raspberry Pi images and never stopped; now they have little ARM clusters tucked behind their routers quietly keeping Ethereum online.
